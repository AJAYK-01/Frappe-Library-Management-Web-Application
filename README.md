# Frappe-Library-Management-Web-Application

### Problem statement [link](https://frappe.io/dev-hiring-test)

## Main Ideas
- Page navigation kept minimal, for quick single page application like usage.
+ Instant search as you type allows fast lookup of books, Debouncing implemented to reduce api calls.
- Keep main functionality at easy reach, issuing and returning book, in the home screen using Side Drawers.
+ Avoid unnecessary prompts for editing small fields, such as Book Stock, has been done with simple edit button within Book details UI.
- Integration to Frappe API done via backend, which scans through several pages of the api as required for larger no of books.
+ CRUD operations implemented through Forms within Modals.
